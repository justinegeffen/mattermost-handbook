# Mattermost U.S. Consulting Agreements

This agreement is typically used for vendors who do not require Mattermost to sign a [custom agreement](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract#procuring-a-vendor). Before you kick off the process, please confirm your vendor satisfies the criteria below. If your vendor does not satisfy the criteria below, this vendor contract should follow the [Procurement Process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/purchasing/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract). If you are not sure, please reach out to [People Ops](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/ask-people-team).

## Criteria

* An individual with an LLC.
* Provide ad-hoc services to Mattermost, examples include:
  * On-going nature: the engagement will exceed 6 months and does not have a fixed end date, e.g. on-going budget approval will not be needed.
  * System Access requirements: the engagement will require system access currently controlled by IT and/or HR.
  
## Process

1. Confirm you have budget approval for this with your Team MLT. If you do not have budget approval, see:  [off-cycle budget process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/budget#off-cycle-budget-approval).
2. The appropriate [CAO](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-agreements#what-are-e-sign-completion-expectations) should complete the [Mattermost U.S. Consulting Agreement Template](https://app.hellosign.com/s/GnvOJVYW). Reference the [field description guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FKef8xf9N_NTEc0owbAGH4mb0UzU8CJQ5qckGvIl1UM/edit) for help.
3. Upon completion, the CAO will receive the document via HelloSign. Forward that email to [HR](mailto:%20hr@mattermost.com) and include your vendor's signatory contact information \(full name and signature\).
4. HR will review the document to ensure the [criteria](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/risk-management/mattermost-templated-agreements#criteria) are met and will forward to the [Procurement Team](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract#step-4-send-for-internal-signature) for internal [signatures](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-agreements#who-can-sign-on-behalf-of-the-company) and CC the [CAO](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-agreements#what-are-e-sign-completion-expectations).
5. Upon receipt of the fully executed agreement please follow [Procurement Step 7](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract#step-7-vendor-on-boarding-and-invoice-processing) to ensure your vendor is set up for payment.
